              Some 8 years ago, the HiExchange team started their activities in
              the Fintech field. Since then, our team has served many customers
              for exchanging their Cryptocurrencies and Different Electronic
              Currencies.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              Of course our story began with exchanging mostly E-Currencies such
              as PayPal, WebMoney and Perfect Money, but as we grew we carefully
              took steps into the Cryptocurrency exchange field to be able to
              respond to our loyal customers needs.
